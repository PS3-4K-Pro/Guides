It allows you to read and write values and addresses in RAM in real-time using a supported device over the local network. It&apos;s typically used for debugging and real time game modding.","Its features include:","-Getting process and process name by PID.","-Make all memory writable for any process.","-Getting process module and module name by prxid.","-Load and unload a process module.","-Get and Unload VSH plugins by name.","-Disable and check any syscall.","-Remove Cobra/Mamba hook.","-Get and set IDPS/PSID at any time.","@Note that in order to modify games, you must first convert their EBOOT to a debug EBOOT. PS3MAPI is supported on both CEX and DEX firmwares.","Forcing Tools to Use PS3MAPI:","Often times, PC tools are built solely for CCAPI. You can force them to use PS3MAPI by extracting the PS3Lib.dll into the tool&apos;s folder from Fake CCAPI.","A set of demo tools built specifically for PS3MAPI can be found [here](http://github.com/LuanTeles/Guides/releases/download/External_Application_-_PS3&trade;_Manager_API.pkg).","Using PS3MAPI via Browser:","If WebMAN-MOD is installed, you can use PS3MAPI with any device on your network by browsing to: [http://&lt;ps3-ip-address&gt;/&lt;/home.ps3mapi&gt;](http://0/home.ps3mapi)","#Debug EBOOT","In order to RTM} (Real-Time Mod) {with a DEX debugger such as TMAPI or CCAPI, you must first convert a game&apos;s EBOOT to a debug EBOOT.
